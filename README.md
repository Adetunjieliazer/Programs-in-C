# Programs in C language

## What is C programming language?

C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it a popular choice for system programming, embedded systems, and low-level software development. C has had a significant influence on the development of many other programming languages and operating systems. It is characterized by its use of structured programming principles, a rich set of operators, and low-level memory manipulation capabilities. C is often used for tasks where precise control over hardware and memory is required, making it a fundamental language in the field of computer science and software development.

* Example of C program
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
<i>To run any of my files, firstly need to clone my repo, then make it executable file for it to run. Run the file with these command lines below:</i>

```
git clone git@github.com:Adetunjieliazer/Programs-in-C.git
chmod a+x *
./[filename]
```

## Working on these
